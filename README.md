ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Anthony (@ananfito). I'm currently employed as a mathematics teacher, but I'm studying to be a front-end web developer. I am currently studying JavaScript, but I also have experience with data analytics, Python, R, and HTML/CSS. I'm looking to connect with others to learn and grow as a developer. You can view my projects & certifications on my portfolio website at [https://ananfito.github.io/](https://ananfito.github.io/). Happy coding!
