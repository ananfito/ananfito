## 👋 Hi, I’m Anthony 
I am a mathematics teacher studying to be a front-end web developer. I'm interested in designing web applications to make the web a fun, safe, and accessible place for everyone. I'm open to mentoring, collaborations, and employment opportunities. I blog about my tech and career transition journey at [Anthony's Techie Thoughts](https://ananfito.hashnode.dev/). Thanks for stopping by. Happy coding!

### 🎯 My Progress: 
- 📖 Currently studying JavaScript, but I have experience with data analytics, Python, R, and HTML/CSS
- 🤝 Looking to connect with others to learn and grow as a developer
